# PlayAces - Smart Fun for Kids!

**Last Updated: November 25, 2025**

**PlayAces** ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting the privacy of our users ("you" or "your"), with a special focus on the safety of children. This Privacy Policy explains how our application handles information to ensure a secure and fun learning experience for families.

## 1. Information We Collect and Store

### A. Personal Information (Stored Locally)
PlayAces offers optional authentication via **Google Sign-In** and **Apple Sign-In**. If you choose to sign in, the App retrieves basic profile information (Name, Email, and Profile Photo) solely to personalize the experience (e.g., displaying your name on the Home Screen).
* **Storage Method:** This information is stored **locally on your device** using secure device storage.
* **No External Transfer:** We **do not** upload, sync, or store your personal information on external servers.

### B. Device Permissions & Local Data

#### Photo Library Access
The App requests access to your device's **Photo Library** (`android.permission.READ_MEDIA_IMAGES` or iOS Photos permission).
* **Usage:** This permission is required solely to enable the "Gallery" activity, which allows children to view their *own* device photos within the App's interface.
* **Data Safety:** These photos are processed **locally on your device**. We do not collect, upload, share, or store your personal photos on our servers or any third-party servers.

#### Microphone Access (Audio Playback)
The App may request or list permissions related to the microphone (`android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO`).
* **Why this appears:** This permission is a technical requirement included by third-party audio libraries (such as `expo-audio`) used to play the high-quality voiceovers for our Alphabet and Numbers games.
* **Our Usage:** PlayAces **DOES NOT** use the microphone to record, collect, or listen to any audio from you or your child. The permission is strictly a byproduct of the sound playback engine.

## 2. Children’s Privacy (COPPA & GDPR-K Compliance)
PlayAces is specifically designed for children ages 2-8. We strictly adhere to the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and GDPR-K standards:
* **No Third-Party Advertising:** We do not display behavioral advertising or use third-party ad networks.
* **No Data Sharing:** We do not sell, trade, or transfer Personally Identifiable Information (PII) to outside parties.
* **No Third-Party Analytics:** We do not use third-party analytics services (such as Google Analytics or Firebase) to track user behavior.
* **Safe Environment:** The App is designed to keep children within a safe, closed environment without external links to websites or social media.

## 3. Account Deletion & Data Retention
You retain full control over your data. PlayAces provides a straightforward way to manage and delete your information directly within the application.

* **In-App Account Deletion:** You may delete your account at any time by navigating to your **Profile** and selecting **"Delete Account"**.
    * This action immediately and permanently wipes all personal data (Name, Email, Photo, Age preferences) from the device.
    * It disconnects the App from your Google or Apple account.
    * This process is irreversible and restores the App to a "fresh install" state.
* **Uninstalling the App:** Since all data is stored locally, uninstalling the application will also permanently delete all user data and preferences associated with PlayAces from your device.
* **Data Retention:** User preferences and Profile data are retained on your device only as long as the App is installed or until you choose to delete your account. We do not hold a copy of your data on any external servers.

## 4. Data Security
We implement robust security measures to protect your information:
* **Encryption:** Authentication tokens transmitted between the App and identity providers (Google/Apple) are encrypted using secure protocols (HTTPS/SSL).
* **Local Processing:** Critical features, such as the Photo Gallery, are designed to function locally, ensuring your personal media never leaves your device.

## 5. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We encourage you to review this policy periodically for any changes.
